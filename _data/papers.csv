1,PSEUDo: Interactive Pattern Search in Multivariate Time Series with Locality-Sensitive Hashing and Relevance Feedback,VDS-KDD_2022_paper_8514.pdf,"Yuncong Yu, Dylan Kruyff, Jiao Jiao, Tim Becker and Michael Behrisch","We present PSEUDo, a visual pattern retrieval tool for multivariate time series. It aims to overcome the uneconomic (re-)training problem accompanying deep learning-based methods. Very high-dimensional time series emerge on an unprecedented scale due to increasing sensor usage and data storage. Visual pattern search is one of the most frequent tasks on time series. Automatic pattern retrieval methods often suffer from inefficient training data, a lack of ground truth labels, and a discrepancy between the similarity perceived by the algorithm and required by the user or the task. Our proposal is based on the query-aware locality-sensitive hashing technique to create a representation of multivariate time series windows. It features sub-linear training and inference time with respect to data dimensions. This performance gain allows an instantaneous relevance-feedback-driven adaption to converge to users’ similarity notion. We demonstrate PSEUDo’s performance in terms of accuracy, speed, steerability, and usability through quantitative benchmarks with representative time series retrieval methods and a case study. We find that PSEUDo detects patterns in high-dimensional time series efficiently, improves the result with relevance feedback through feature selection, and allows an understandable as well as user-friendly retrieval process.",Paper
2,An Interpretable Neuron Embedding for Static Knowledge Distillation,VDS-KDD_2022_paper_5524.pdf,"Wei Han, Yangqiming Wang, Christian Boehm and Junming Shao","Although deep neural networks have shown well-performance in various tasks, the poor interpretability of the models is always criticized. In the paper, we propose a new interpretable neural network method, by embedding neurons into the semantic space to extract their intrinsic global semantics. In contrast to previous methods that probe latent knowledge inside the model, the proposed semantic vector externalizes the latent knowledge to static knowledge, which is easy to exploit. Specifically, we assume that neurons with similar activation are of similar semantic information. Afterwards, semantic vectors are optimized by continuously aligning activation similarity and semantic vector similarity during the training of the neural network. The visualization of semantic vectors allows for a qualitative explanation of the neural network. Moreover, we assess the static knowledge quantitatively by knowledge distillation tasks. Empirical experiments of visualization show that semantic vectors describe neuron activation semantics well. Without the sample-by-sample guidance from the teacher model, static knowledge distillation exhibit comparable or even superior performance with existing relation-based knowledge distillation methods.",Paper

4,Motif-Based Visual Analysis of Dynamic Networks,,"Eren Cakmak, Johannes Fuchs, Dominik Jäckle, Tobias Schreck, Ulrik Brandes, Daniel Keim","Many data analysis problems rely on dynamic networks, such as social or communication network analyses. Providing a scalable overview of long sequences of such dynamic networks remains challenging due to the underlying large-scale data containing elusive topological changes. We propose two complementary pixel-based visualizations, which reflect occurrences of selected sub-networks (motifs) and provide a time-scalable overview of dynamic networks: a network-level census (motif significance profiles) linked with a node-level sub-network metric (graphlet degree vectors) views to reveal structural changes, trends, states, and outliers. The network census captures significantly occurring motifs compared to their expected occurrences in random networks and exposes structural changes in a dynamic network. The sub-network metrics display the local topological neighborhood of a node in a single network belonging to the dynamic network. The linked pixel-based visualizations allow exploring motifs in different-sized networks to analyze the changing structures within and across dynamic networks, for instance, to visually analyze the shape and rate of changes in the network topology. We describe the identification of visual patterns, also considering different reordering strategies to emphasize visual patterns. We demonstrate the approach's usefulness by a use case analysis based on real-world large-scale dynamic networks, such as the evolving social networks of Reddit or Facebook.",Paper
5,"How Do Data Science Workers Communicate Intermediate Results?",,"Yuren Pang, Ruotong Wang, Joely Nelson, Leilani Battle","Data science workers increasingly collaborate on large-scale projects before communicating insights to a broader audience in the form of visualization. While prior work has modeled how data science teams, oftentimes with distinct roles and work processes, communicate knowledge to outside stakeholders, we have little knowledge of how data science workers communicate intermediately before delivering the final products. In this work, we contribute a nuanced description of the intermediate communication process within data science teams. By analyzing interview data with 8 self-identified data science workers, we characterized the data science intermediate communication process with four factors, including the types of audience, communication goals, shared artifacts, and mode of communication. We also identified three overarching challenges in the current communication process. We also discussed design implications that might inform better tools that facilitate intermediate communication within data science teams.",Paper
6,BiaScope: Visual Unfairness Diagnosis for Graph Embeddings,,"Agapi Rissaki, Bruno Scarone, David Liu, Aditeya Pandey, Brennan Klein, Tina Eliassi-Rad, Michelle A. Borkin","The issue of bias (i.e., systematic unfairness) in machine learning models has recently attracted the attention of both researchers and practitioners. For the graph mining community in particular, an important goal toward algorithmic fairness is to detect and mitigate bias incorporated into graph embeddings since they are commonly used in human-centered applications, e.g., social-media recommendations. However, simple analytical methods for detecting bias typically involve aggregate statistics which do not reveal the sources of unfairness. Instead, visual methods can provide a holistic fairness characterization of graph embeddings and help uncover the causes of observed bias. In this work, we present BiaScope, an interactive visualization tool that supports end-to-end visual unfairness diagnosis for graph embeddings. The tool is the product of a design study in collaboration with domain experts. It allows the user to (i) visually compare two embeddings with respect to fairness, (ii) locate nodes or graph communities that are unfairly embedded, and (iii) understand the source of bias by interactively linking the relevant embedding subspace with the corresponding graph topology. Experts' feedback confirms that our tool is effective at detecting and diagnosing unfairness. Thus, we envision our tool both as a companion for researchers in designing their algorithms as well as a guide for practitioners who use off-the-shelf graph embeddings.",Paper
7,Comparison of Computational Notebook Systems for Interactive Visual Analytics,,"Han Liu","Existing notebook platforms have different capabilities for supporting visual analytics use. It is not clear which platform to choose for implementing visual analytics notebooks. In this work, we investigated the problem using Andromeda, an interactive dimension reduction algorithm, and implemented it using three different notebook platforms: 1) Python-based Jupyter Notebook, 2) JavaScript-based Observable Notebook, and 3) Jupyter Notebook embedding both Python (data science use) and JavaScript (visual analytics use). We also made comparisons for all the notebook platforms via a case study based on metrics such as programming difficulty, notebook organization, interactive performance, and UI design choice. Furthermore, guidelines are provided for data scientists to choose one notebook platform for implementing their visual analytics notebooks in various situations. Laying the groundwork for future developers, advice is also given on architecting better notebook platforms.",Paper
8,Interactive Visualization for Data Science Scripts ,,"Rebecca Faust, Carlos Scheidegger, Katherine E. Isaacs, William Bernstein, Michael Sharp, Chris North","As the field of data science continues to grow, so does the need for adequate tools to understand and debug data science scripts. Current debugging practices fall short when applied to a data science setting, due to the exploratory and iterative nature of analysis scripts. Additionally, computational notebooks, the preferred scripting environment of many data scientists, present additional challenges to understanding and debugging workflows, including the non-linear execution of code snippets. This paper presents Anteater, a trace-based visual debugging method for data science scripts. Anteater automatically traces and visualizes execution data with minimal analysts input. These visualizations illustrate execution and value behaviors that assist in understanding the results of analysis scripts. To maximize the number of workflows supported, we present prototype implementations in both Python and Jupyter. Last, to demonstrate Anteater’s support for analysis understanding tasks, we provide two usage scenarios on real world analysis scripts.",Paper
9,Communication Analysis through Visual Analytics: Current Practices Challenges and New Frontiers,,"Maximilian T. Fischer, Frederik L. Dennig, Daniel Seebacher, Daniel Keim, Mennatallah El-Assady","The automated analysis of digital human communication data often focuses on specific aspects such as content or network structure in isolation. This can provide limited perspectives while making cross-methodological analyses in domains like investigative journalism difficult. Communication research in psychology and the digital humanities instead stresses the importance of a holistic approach to overcome these limiting factors. In this work, we conduct an extensive survey on the properties of over forty semi-automated communication analysis systems and investigate how they cover concepts described in theoretical communication research. From these investigations, we derive a design space and contribute a conceptual framework based on communication research, technical considerations, and the surveyed approaches. The framework describes the systems' properties, capabilities, and composition through a wide range of criteria organized in the dimensions (1) Data, (2) Processing and Models, (3) Visual Interface, and (4) Knowledge Generation. These criteria enable a formalization of digital communication analysis through visual analytics, which, we argue, is uniquely suited for this task by tackling automation complexity while leveraging domain knowledge. With our framework, we identify shortcomings and research challenges, such as group communication dynamics, trust and privacy considerations, and holistic approaches. Simultaneously, our framework supports the evaluation of systems.",Paper
