We encourage you to submit original work that emphasizes the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. Accepted submissions have the opportunity to present at VDS events at both [ACM KDD](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2022/) and [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/year/2022/welcome).  This event accepts full and short paper submissions for talks.

### Full Papers (up to 8 pages)

Paper submissions should describe the role, application, and impact of visualization in data science. We would like to particularly encourage papers that cross disciplinary boundaries and show how visualization in data science can be a catalyst for discovery. Papers will be published on our website.  In addition, we plan to recommend extended versions of selected papers in a special issue of the journal, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).

Papers that integrate visualization with any stages of the data science pipeline (collecting data, cleaning data, mining data, exploring data, and communicating data) would be welcome as submissions to VDS.

### Short Papers (up to 4 pages)

We also accept short papers, with similar themes as described in the Full Paper track above.  However, we will not recommend extended versions of the short papers to IEEE TVCG due to their shorter length.

### Review Process (Double blind)

Paper submissions will be managed by the Program Chairs and sent to the Program Committee to evaluate the work’s novelty and significance.  Your work reviewed via a double-blind process; to do this, simply be sure to exclude all identifying information in the submitted manuscript file, ensuring that the reviewers will not know the identity of the authors. Otherwise, the review process will be single-blind, i.e., the reviewers will know the identity of the authors, but the authors will not know the identity of the reviewers.

### Paper Submission and Formatting Guidelines

Submissions should be no more than 8 pages long excluding references for full papers -- and 4 pages for short papers.  Papers should follow the formatting guidelines for [IEEE VIS TVCG Journal submissions](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/journal).  Papers should include full-color figures throughout and we encourage authors to showcase their work with annotated, well described, large, and detailed graphics. We also encourage the placement of a teaser image at the top of the very first page to showcase your work visually.
